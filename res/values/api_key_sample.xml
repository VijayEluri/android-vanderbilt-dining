		If you join the project, and get errors about not have a resource
		string/maps_api_key, then you need to go to
		http://code.google.com/android/maps-api-signup.html to acquire a
		google maps API key (each developer needs their own). After you have
		done that, uncomment the line below and fill in your key. You should
		then be able to see the maps in this application. If you have trouble
		generating an API key, know that you can always uncomment the line
		below and still run the application, and the Google map data will not
		be presented (because you obviously have provided an invalid API key).
		If you are not working on the maps part, then perhaps this is not an
		issue for you ;)
