	/*
	 * Currently, only the hours for restaurants indexed 0 to 4 have been filled, and if another restaurant is 
	 * currently clicked then application fails. Application won't fail if rest of hours arrays are filled.
	 * Need to be able to convert String arrays below to actual Calendar objects so that it will be possible to 
	 * compare times a restaurant opens and closes with the internal system clock.
	 * 
	 * Database should fix above problems,      austin: In the meantime, wouldnt it be easier to just reperesent 
	 * 													the below with calendar objects to begin with, then convert to string?
	 * 
	 * Problem not addressed is that Rand like a few other restaurants opens and closes more than once in a day
	 * 
	 * Need to address also that in the main.xml file, I am unable to change the font color of the names of the 
	 * restaurants in the listview. This will be necessary in order to show whether or not a restaurant is
	 * open or closed. White font and position near top of list will indicate that a restaurant is open 
	 * and grey font and position near the bottom of the list will indicate that a restaurant is closed.
	 * Later ideas could include placing green light next to open names and red lights next to closed names.
	 *
